# React Drum machine

This is a React app that you can use just for fun. Its a fun way way to learn to play the drum.

###### What I've learnt

- React life cycles.
- Diferences between state and props.
- Moving properties through the DOM tree other other components.
- Adding classes and css styles dynamically.
- Maintaining clean code by seprating UI components from logical components.
